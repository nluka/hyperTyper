          <h1>Information about this project</h1>
          <hr />

          <h2>Purpose</h2>
          <p>
            The purpose of this project was to learn <strong>HTML5</strong>,
            <strong>CSS3</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, as well as
            gain some experience building a large project on my own - getting
            out of "tutorial hell" as it's referred to. This project is entirely
            my creation, and isn't based on tutorial projects.<br /><br />
            This game/application is meant to be an alternative to popular
            online platforms for practicing typing skills, such as
            <a href="https://play.typeracer.com/" target="blank"
              >typeracer.com</a
            >, <a href="https://www.keybr.com/" target="blank">keybr.com</a>,
            etc. his is not intended to be commercial software, but rather as a
            resume project to demonstrate my knowledge and skills in the 3
            aforementioned languages and my ability to plan, develop, and
            maintain a large, real world application. I consider this project
            unique because it addresses some gripes I had with popular platforms
            that I used when deciding to learn 10 finger touch typing. I took
            the features I liked from these platforms and made improvements in
            areas that I felt were lacking. This is the app I use to continually
            practice my typing speed, accuracy, and consistency.
          </p>

          <h2>What I Learned</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Fundamentals of web development with <strong>HTML5</strong>,
              <strong>CSS3</strong>, <strong>JavaScript (ES6)</strong>
            </li>
            <li>Interacting with and consuming an <strong>API</strong></li>
            <li>
              <strong>Finding, reading, understanding documentation</strong>
              related to web development
            </li>
            <li>
              Improved my <strong>troubleshooting and debugging skills</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>DOM traversal and manipulation</strong> (used extensively
              throughout the project)
            </li>
            <li>
              Basics of <strong>Regex</strong> (Regular Expression), and using
              it in JS
            </li>
            <li><strong>JSON</strong></li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Code and Style Conventions</h2>
          <p>
            This project follows certain conventions, which are laid out in the
            text files within the <strong>docs</strong> folder. This includes
            the <strong>general-conventions.txt</strong>,
            <strong>html-conventions.txt</strong>,
            <strong>css-conventions.txt</strong>, and
            <strong>js-conventions.txt</strong> files.
          </p>

          <h2>Terminology</h2>
          <p>
            This section will explain certain terminology in this project to
            make it easier to understand the code.
            <br /><br />
            The term <i>phrase</i> refers to a randomly generated string that
            can consists of random words, letters, numbers, and symbols with
            spaces between them. These are called <i>items</i>. The user selects
            what lists they want to include, and the phrase is generated with
            random items from those selected lists. <br /><br />
            The term <i>quote</i> refers to a literal quote with an author. This
            project consumes the
            <a href="https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable">api.quotable.io</a>
            API, and falls back to the quotes in
            <strong>/js/play/expression-resources/quotes.js</strong> if the API
            cannot be consumed. Quotes in <strong>quotes.js</strong> are stored
            as objects with a <strong>"text"</strong> key that holds the quote
            itself as a string, and an <strong>"author"</strong> key which holds
            the author's name as a string.<br /><br />
            The term <i>expression</i> refers to the string of text that appears
            on the page for the user to type. This expression can be either a
            randomly generated phrase or a quote, which were discussed above. It
            cannot be a mix of both, they are separate modes of play.
          </p>

          <h2>Compatibility</h2>
          <p>
            This project was developed with the following browsers in mind (in
            descending priority):
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Google Chrome</strong>, <strong>Safari</strong>,
            <strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong>, <strong>Microsoft Edge</strong>,
            <strong>Opera</strong>. <br /><br />
            Functionality and compatibility will be optimized for Chrome, because
            that is by far the most popular browser at the time of writing and
            development, and it is the browser I use to develop in. However,
            this project tries to ensure compatibility for the other
            aforementioned browsers when possible, but this is not a guarantee.
            For the best experience, Chrome should be used. Internet Explorer is
            not supported because it lacks many CSS and JS features that this
            project utilizes.
          </p>

          <h2>Future</h2>
          <p>
            This project will likely be expanded and updated in the future. New
            features may be added and existing ones overhauled. After releasing
            version 1.0 I am moving on to other projects, but there is a high
            chance I will come back to this at some point.
          </p>
