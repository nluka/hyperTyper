The following are the style conventions for all JS code in this project.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1. Any variables that reference HTML elements should mention what element type
they hold at the end of their name, separated by an underscore.

  for example:

  let somePanel_div;
  let _body;
  let phraseList_buttons (this is an example of an array of elements)

2. In places where tracking the type of data a variable holds is relevant,
variable names should indicate the type of data they will hold; at the end of
their name, separated by an underscore.

  for example:

  let soundVolume_float = 0.2;
  let expression_str = "Some text.";
