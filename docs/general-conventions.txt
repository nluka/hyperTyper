The following are the style conventions for all code files in this project.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

1. Line length should, when possible, be <= 80 columns. This is to allow for at
least 2 files open side-by-side in one editor window, and for general
readability. An exception can be made for lines where content doesn't matter
such as a url (@import), or where a newline would break code, such as in the
middle of a string.

2. Always use 2 real-spaces for indentation. Never use tabs.

3. Ensure trailing-whitespace is trimmed, editor should be configured to do so.

4. Add comments sparingly. Use them to label sections of code in a large file,
but avoid using comments to explain single lines whenever possible. Code should
be self explanatory, if it isn't, fix it to be so.
