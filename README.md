# hyperTyper

## Introduction

hyperTyper is a highly-customizable web application designed for practicing typing skills in a very comprehensive way. It is meant to improve upon popular platforms such as typeracer.com, keybr.com, 10fastfingers, etc. It takes inspiration from these platforms, makes changes and adds useful tools and features. I designed this application to be the most effective way to practice typing skills for everyone, including programmers. In my opinion, hyperTyper is a vast improvement to the aforementioned platforms and is thus my platform of choice for working on my typing skills.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project was to learn web development with HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript and gain practical programming/development experience by building a large, real world project on my own - to get out of "tutorial hell". This project is entirely my creation, and isn't based on tutorial projects.

## What I Learned

* Fundamentals of web development with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript
* Web design principles and how to apply them in an unconventional project
* Refactoring, and the importance of writing clean code
* API consumption with fetch
* Using GitHub as a repository and a host platform
* Finding, reading, understanding documentation related to web development
* Asynchronous programming in JavaScript
* DOM traversal and manipulation (used extensively throughout the project)
* Debugging in the browser
* Regular Expressions
* JSON

## Code and Style Conventions

This project follows certain conventions, which are outlined out in the text files within /docs. There is also a project lexicon there.

## Compatibility

This project was developed with several modern browsers in mind, such as Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera. I have tried to maximize compatibility across those browser, but this project was developed with Google Chrome (because of it's many useful features) and thus makes it the best browser in this regard. Browsers running old versions of JavaScript (ES5 or older) are not supported.

## Future

This project is still being expanded and worked upon. There are many plans for new features, as well as changes/improvements to existing ones. To see what's in store, check out the Trello board: https://trello.com/b/S7YE0keL.
